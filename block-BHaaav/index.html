            Solids generally exhibit certain characteristics that set them apart
            from liquids and gases. For example, they have the ability to resist
            any force that is applied to its surface. However, the solid-state
            of compounds largely depends on the properties of atoms such as
            their arrangement and the forces acting between them.
